# Here the quick 'n dirty guide to adding a new OS to quickget
#
#    1. Update os_support() - add new OS, all lowercase
#    2. Update pretty_name() - add a pretty name for new OS *only if the catch all is not suitable*
#    3. Update os_homepages() - add a homepage for new OS
#    4. Create a releases_newos() generator (required) outputs the current supported release versions
#    5. Create a editions_newos() generator (optional) outputs the editions if new OS has multiple flavours/editions
#    6. Update make_vm_config() - add any *required* new OS tweaks
#    7. Create a get_newos() function - that does something like this:
#
#function get_newos() {
#    local EDITION="${1:-}"
#    local HASH=""
#    local ISO="newos-${RELEASE}-${EDITION}-amd64.iso"
#    local URL="https://www.newos.org/download/${RELEASE}/${EDITION}"
#
#    HASH=$(wget -q -O- "${URL}/SHA512SUMS" | grep "${ISO}" | cut -d' ' -f1)
#    echo "${URL}/${ISO} ${HASH}"
#}

function cleanup() {
  if [ -n "$(jobs -p)" ]; then
    kill "$(jobs -p)"

    # Command translated: ./Fido -Win 10 -Lang English -Verbose
    # "English" = "English (United States)" (as opposed to the default "English (International)")
    # For testing Fido, replace all "https://" with "http://" and remove all instances of "-MaximumRedirection 0" (to allow redirection of HTTP traffic to HTTPS) so HTTP requests can easily be inspected in Wireshark
    # Fido (command-line only) works under PowerShell for Linux if that makes it easier for you
    # UPDATE: Fido v1.4.2+ no longer works without being edited on Linux due to these issues on the Fido GitHub repo (and possibly others after these): #56 and #58
    #
    # If this function in Mido fails to work for you then please test with the Fido script before creating an issue because we basically just copy what Fido does exactly:
