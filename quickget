# Here the quick 'n dirty guide to adding a new OS to quickget
#
# 1. Update os_support() - add new OS, all lowercase
# 2. Update os_info() - Fill all posible fields for new OS (leave empty if no login, but | must stay same)
#    Here is whats should be there...
#    <OS name>)     INFO="<OS nice name>|<OS based on>|<OS default login:pass if any>|<OS homepage>|<ABOUT>";;
# 4. Create a releases_newos() generator (required) outputs the current supported release versions (from newest)
# 5. Create a editions_newos() generator (optional) outputs the editions if new OS has multiple flavours/editions
# 6. Update make_vm_config() - add any *required* new OS tweaks
# 7. Create a get_newos() function - that does something like this: (Look at other OS)
#    For cutting first field with hash you can use function `cut_1` instead of `cut -d' ' -f1``
#
#function get_newos() {
#    local EDITION="${1:-}"
#    local HASH=""
#    local ISO="newos-${RELEASE}-${EDITION}-amd64.iso"
#    local URL="https://www.newos.org/download/${RELEASE}/${EDITION}"
#
#    HASH=$(web_pipe "${URL}/SHA512SUMS" | grep "${ISO}" | cut_1)
#    echo "${URL}/${ISO} ${HASH}"
#}
